I successfully refactored the existing code to make it more accessible according to the criteria. I also cleaned up the CSS style page, making it look more proffesional.

## User Story

```

SO THAT our site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
